# THANKS FOR BEING HERE:

## CURRENTLY WE NEED:

1. `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` editting with clear instructions and robust information.
2. Finalize `STRINGS` portion of this tool
3. Fix the console graphics (colors on light themed terminals, box sizes, etc)

## README.md

## STRINGS

1. Go to `data/examples/strings.js` where you can see
   an extensive object related to strings.
2. Choose a key that doesn't yet have a value.
3. Use TEMPLATE LITERAL to add an example.
4. Make sure your example is clear, concise, and accurate, even if it takes looking into the official docs.
5. Go to `data/descriptions/strings.js` where you can see an extensive object related to strings
6. Select the same method/property you worked on for the example, and add a very objective yet accurate description of it.

NOTE: When adding examples, please be sure to also show `//output: example`

RUN THE TOOL!!!
After running it and ensuring you're satisfied with your results, open a PR to the `development` branch.

NOTE: PRs open directly to `main` will NOT be merged.
